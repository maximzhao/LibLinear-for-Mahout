      <div><h2> Introduction</h2>
          The sequential SVM package provides Binary Classification, Multi-classification and Regression based on <A HREF="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/code/index.html">Pegasos</A>. 
          The format of datasets is exactly as same as SVMlight and Libsvm, and the datasets could be stored on Hadoop cluster and local computer.
      </div>
      <div><h2> Implementation </h2>
          <p> Currently, this package provides (Features):
          <ol>
              <li>Sequential SVM linear solver, include training and testing </li>
              <li>Support general file system and HDFS right now</li>
              <li>Supporting large-scale data set training. Because of the Pegasos only need to sample certain samples, this package supports to pre-fetch
the certain size (e.g. max iteration) of samples to memory.
For example: if the size of data set has 100,000,000 samples, due to the default maximum iteration is 100,000,
as the result, this package only random load 100,000 samples to memory</li>
              <li>Supoorting Multi-classfication based on Map-Reduce framework</li>
              <li>Supporting Regression</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
